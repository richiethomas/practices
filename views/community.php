		<a class="float-end mx-3" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wgimprovschool"><img src='images/twitch_screen.png' alt='twitch screenshot'></a>
		<p>First of all, we have online shows that are broadcast on our Twitch channel.<br><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wgimprovschool">https://www.twitch.tv/wgimprovschool</a></p>

		<p>Twitch is like YouTube, but it mostly shows stuff that is being streamed live, like a little thing called television. If there's a show on at that moment it will be playing, or else you can pick any show from the previous two weeks.</p>
		<p>Twitch is very easy to use. You can watch shows without signing up -- just go to our channel. If you DO sign up for a Twitch account (which is free), you can chat and also "follow" our channel, which means you'll get an email whenever a show is starting.</p>
