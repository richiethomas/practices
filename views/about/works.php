<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>You enroll in classes on this site. When you do, you'll get an email with either the physical address if it's an in-person class, or a zoom link if it's an online class.</p>

<h2>How Do I Enroll?</h2>

<p>First, you sign in to the site (click 'login' in the nav bar at the top). You enter an email, we send you a link. No passwords.</p>

<p>Once signed in, you click on a class and then "enroll" to enroll. If it's full you can join the waiting list.</p>

<p>After you are enrolled, you'll get an email with either a physical address or a link to a Zoom session.</p>

<p>A lot happens over email. That's how you'll get reminders, updates, etc.</p>

<h2>What Classes Do You Offer?</h2>

<p>We have a four level program of teaching premise-based, game of the scene long-form improv. We offer those classes online also, and there's also a rotating set of classes for advanced students, kind of like an informal online grad school. </p>

<h2>How Can I Find Out When You Post More Classes?</h2>

<p>There's no fixed schedule of when we post them. It depends on when the teachers are available to teach. The best way to stay abreast of new classes is join our Facebook Group or our Discord chat server (for more info on those see our <a href='/community'>community page</a>).</p>



<h2>How Do I Pay?</h2>

<p>You pay via Venmo (@wgimprovschool) or Paypal (payments@wgimprovschool.com) when you can, before start of class.</p>

<p>If you drop out of a class with less than 24 hours notice, we may ask you pay anyway. If we fill your spot, we'll refund you.</p>

<h2>Do I Need Prior Experience?</h2>

<p>Usually you decide if you're ready by reading the description of the class. Some classes have specific pre-requisities. If you're not sure, email Will (address at bottom of site) and he might grant an exception.</p>

<h2>Does Improv and Sketch Really Work Over Zoom?</h2>

<p>Yes, it's surprisingly fun! You'll have to be a little patient when everyone talks over each other. We will tell each other when we have frozen. You know, Zoom stuff. But yes it works!</p>


<h2>How Can I Meet The Other People Doing This?</h2>

<p>We have an active online community. Read about shows, chat, teams and more on our <a href='/community'>community page</a>.</p>


<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>Our mailing list is the best way to be kept up on new classes.</p>

<p>You are NOT automatically put on a mailing list when you take a class. You have to explicitly <a href="http://eepurl.com/R2Ytz">sign yourself up</a>.</p>
